/**
 * DynamicVbPool — a reuse pool for the transient vertex buffers that back
 * DrawPrimitiveUP-style draws.
 *
 * Why: every DrawPrimitiveUP previously did `device.createBuffer({...})` +
 * `buffer.destroy()` per call. NFSU's car-select menu issues ~36K UP draws/sec,
 * so that's ~36K GPU buffer create+destroy pairs/sec — pure driver/allocator
 * churn plus a `new Uint8Array(data)` staging copy per draw feeding the GC.
 *
 * This pool sub-buckets free buffers by their allocated capacity (rounded up to a
 * power of two, min 256 B) and hands back a buffer >= the requested size. After
 * the frame is submitted, the device returns each buffer here for reuse instead
 * of destroying it. WebGPU queue ordering makes reuse safe without a fence: a
 * `writeBuffer` into a recycled buffer is sequenced after the prior frame's draws
 * that read it (all on the one device queue), so the GPU never sees a torn write.
 *
 * Buffers are VERTEX | COPY_DST (the exact usage the old per-draw path used).
 * A per-bucket cap bounds idle VRAM; overflow buffers are destroyed.
